# My strategie
To win the game,I have to conquer the enemy HQ(Base) or I have to conquer more zones than the enemy.My strategie starts with the quote "Two are better than 1".When the game is started,I separate my first PODs in to 2 PODs. Also,If I have a PODs that its power more or equal to 20,I separate it into 2 PODSs.By doing these, I will have more PODs.So, I will be able to conquer more zone.When I want to move my PODs,I check for the owner of the neighbour zones.My first choice is alwasy to move enemy's zone to have more conquered zones than the enemy did,if enemy does not have any neighbour zone, I will move to neutral zones.If I have the all the neighbour zones, I will move randomly.So with my strategie, my first aim is not conquering the enemy base but conquering more zones than my enemy.By separating PODs,beside having more conquered zones,I will have more platinium and I will have more PODs.So,Enemy will have lower chance to conquer my base.
